# This file is an alternative option for the blacklist filter. By default,
# the blacklist will handle each word said by someone and determine to
# the best of the algorithms ability if a word is blacklisted or not.
#
# This file is ONLY used if the secondary option for the filter is activated.
# This filter works with selected words being available to be seen by everyone;
# then, other words that are deemed more 'selective' are only seen by those who have
# the permission to see said words (there is a command that can enable this option).
# Finally, any words that are NOT within the these two categories are automatically
# rejected. Note that rejected words effect everyone evenly, meaning even OPPED
# players will have their sentence rejected. If someone does NOT have their option
# turned on to see the selective words, then the ENTIRE sentence will be filtered.
# The message will still be sent, but will be replaced with '######' for the entire
# chat message.
#
# By default, a word collection is used for handling, the options below add configuration
# to said words if you want to manually set them to the specified category. You can also
# add words to these list if the word does not exist within the collection. If the word used
# does not exist within the collection, it will automatically be set to REJECT.


# NOTE:
# You do not need to put every word into this file, several files already exist with a large
# collection, this is only if the word does not exist (by some chance), or is mislabeled and
# needs to be manually set.
