# This file is where you can put messages that'll appear in-game for announcements
# and advertisement. There are several options to when and where the messages can
# appear. Three options are available for where the message will be sent; CHAT, ACTIONBAR, SCREEN.
#
# By default, the announcements are turned off. This setting can be found within the
# 'config.yml' file for this plugin. To add configuration, all announcements have the option
# to not be sent to players who possess specific permission(s). Each announcement can contain
# a list of all permissions that can be counted as having exempt from being sent the announcement.
